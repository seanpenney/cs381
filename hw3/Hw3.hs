--a)
	--1. The return type of f and g are both lists, however, the types of x and y in f are the same and are different for g.
	--2. Y is contained in a list, so x has to be a list as well.
	--3. g would be more general, since x and y are not limited to be the same type.
	--4. They could be the same type, but g has more flexibility in the input types of x and y.

--The following function, for example works.

h :: A -> B

--However, if the types are changed to lowercase like in the pdf, it would not compile, because types can't be lowercase.
